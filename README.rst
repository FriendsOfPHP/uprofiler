uprofiler
=========

Introduction
------------

uprofiler is a hierarchical profiler for PHP. It reports function-level call
counts and **inclusive** and **exclusive** metrics such as wall (elapsed) time,
CPU time and memory usage. A function's profile can be broken down by callers
or callees. The raw data collection component is implemented in C as a PHP Zend
extension called ``uprofiler``. uprofiler has a simple HTML based user
interface (written in PHP). The browser based UI for viewing profiler results
makes it easy to view results or to share results with peers. A callgraph image
view is also supported.

uprofiler reports can often be helpful in understanding the structure of the code
being executed. The hierarchical nature of the reports can be used to
determine, for example, what chain of calls led to a particular function
getting called.

uprofiler supports ability to compare two runs (a.k.a. "diff" reports) or
aggregate data from multiple runs. Diff and aggregate reports, much like single
run reports, offer "flat" as well as "hierarchical" views of the profile.

uprofiler is a light-weight instrumentation based profiler. During the data
collection phase, it keeps track of call counts and inclusive metrics for arcs
in the dynamic callgraph of a program. It computes exclusive metrics in the
reporting/post processing phase. uprofiler handles recursive functions by
detecting cycles in the callgraph at data collection time itself and avoiding
the cycles by giving unique depth qualified names for the recursive
invocations.

uprofiler's light-weight nature and aggregation capabilities make it well suited
for collecting "function-level" performance statistics from production
environments.

Originally developed at Facebook, uprofiler was open sourced in Mar, 2009.

uprofiler Overview
------------------

uprofiler provides:

* **Flat profile**

  Function-level summary information such as number of calls,
  inclusive/exclusive wall time, memory usage, and CPU time.

  .. image:: http://get.uprofiler.io/sample-flat-view.jpg

* **Hierarchical profile** (Parent/Child View)

  For each function, it provides a breakdown of calls and times per parent
  (caller) & child (callee), such as:

  * what functions call a particular function and how many times?
  * what functions does a particular function call?
  * the total time spent under a function when called from a particular parent.

  .. image:: http://get.uprofiler.io/sample-parent-child-view.jpg

* **Diff Reports**

  You may want to compare data from two uprofiler runs for various reasons-- to
  figure out what's causing a regression between one version of the code base
  to another, to evaluate the performance improvement of a code change you are
  making, and so on.

  A diff report takes two runs as input and provides both flat function-level
  diff information, and hierarchical information (breakdown of diff by
  parent/children functions) for each function.

  The "flat" view in the diff report points out the top regressions &
  improvements.

  .. image:: http://get.uprofiler.io/sample-diff-report-flat-view.jpg

  Clicking on functions in the "flat" view of the diff report, leads to the
  "hierarchical" (or parent/child) diff view of a function. We can get a
  breakdown of the diff by parent/children functions.

  .. image:: http://get.uprofiler.io/sample-diff-report-parent-child-view.jpg

* **Callgraph View**

  The profile data can also be viewed as a callgraph. The callgraph view
  highlights the critical path of the program.

  .. image:: http://get.uprofiler.io/sample-callgraph-image.jpg

* **Memory Profile**

  uprofiler's memory profile mode helps track functions that allocate lots of
  memory.

  It is worth clarifying that that uprofiler doesn't strictly track each
  allocation/free operation. Rather it uses a more simplistic scheme. It tracks
  the increase/decrease in the amount of memory allocated to PHP between each
  function's entry and exit. It also tracks increase/decrease in the amount of
  **peak** memory allocated to PHP for each function.

* uprofiler tracks ``include, include_once, require and require_once``
  operations as if they were functions. The name of the file being included is
  used to generate the name for these "fake" functions (see below).

Terminology
-----------

* **Inclusive Time** (or **Subtree Time**): Includes time spent in the function
  as well as in descendant functions called from a given function.

* **Exclusive Time/Self Time**: Measures time spent in the function itself.
  Does not include time in descendant functions.

* **Wall Time**: a.k.a. Elapsed time or wall clock time.

* **CPU Time**: CPU time in user space + CPU time in kernel space.

Naming convention for special functions
---------------------------------------

* ``main()``: a fictitious function that is at the root of the call graph.

* ``load::<filename>`` and ``run_init::<filename>``:

  uprofiler tracks PHP ``include``/``require`` operations as function
  calls.

  For example, an ``include "lib/common.php";`` operation will result in two
  uprofiler function entries:

  * ``load::lib/common.php``: This represents the work done by the interpreter
    to compile/load the file. [Note: If you are using a PHP opcode cache like
    APC, then the compile only happens on a cache miss in APC.]

  * ``run_init::lib/common.php``: This represents initialization code executed
    at the file scope as a result of the include operation.

* ``foo@<n>``: Implies that this is a recursive invocation of ``foo()``, where
  ``<>`` represents the recursion depth. The recursion may be direct (such as
  due to ``foo() --> foo()``), or indirect (such as due to ``foo() --> goo()
  --> foo()``).

Limitations
-----------

True hierarchical profilers keep track of a full call stack at every data
gathering point, and are later able to answer questions like: what was the cost
of the 3rd invokation of ``foo()``? or what was the cost of ``bar()`` when the
call stack looked like ``a()->b()->bar()``?

uprofiler keeps track of only 1-level of calling context and is therefore only
able to answer questions about a function looking either 1-level up or 1-level
down. It turns out that in practice this is sufficient for most use cases.

To make this more concrete, take for instance the following example. Say you
have:

.. code-block:: text

 1 call from a() --> c()
 1 call from b() --> c()
 50 calls from c() --> d()

While uprofiler can tell you that ``d()`` was called from ``c()`` 50 times, it cannot
tell you how many of those calls were triggered due to ``a()`` vs. ``b()``. [We could
speculate that perhaps 25 were due to ``a()`` and 25 due to ``b()``, but that's not
necessarily true.]

In practice however, this isn't a very big limitation.

Installing the uprofiler Extension
----------------------------------

The extension lives in the "extension/" sub-directory.

.. note::

   A windows port hasn't been implemented yet. We have tested uprofiler on
   Linux/FreeBSD and on Mac OS so far.

.. note::

  uprofiler uses the RDTSC instruction (time stamp counter) to implement a
  really low overhead timer for elapsed time. So at the moment uprofiler only
  works on x86 architecture. Also, since RDTSC values may not be synchronized
  across CPUs, uprofiler binds the program to a single CPU during the profiling
  period.

  uprofiler's RDTSC based timer functionality doesn't work correctly if
  **SpeedStep** technology is turned on. This technology is available on some
  Intel processors. [Note: Mac desktops and laptops typically have SpeedStep
  turned on by default. To use uprofiler, you'll need to disable SpeedStep.]

The steps below should work for Linux/Unix environments:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd extension/
   $ phpize
   $ ./configure --with-php-config=path-to-php-config
   $ make
   $ make install

``php.ini`` file: You can update your php.ini file to automatically load your
extension. Add the following to your php.ini file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [uprofiler]
    extension=uprofiler.so
    ;
    ; directory used by default implementation of the iuprofilerRuns
    ; interface (namely, the uprofilerRuns_Default class) for storing
    ; uprofiler runs.
    ;
    uprofiler.output_dir=<directory_for_storing_uprofiler_runs>

Profiling using uprofiler
-------------------------

Test generating raw profiler data using a sample test program like:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php

    // foo.php

    function bar($x) {
      if ($x > 0) {
        bar($x - 1);
      }
    }

    function foo() {
      for ($idx = 0; $idx < 2; $idx++) {
        bar($idx);
        $x = strlen("abc");
      }
    }

    // start profiling
    uprofiler_enable();

    // run program
    foo();

    // stop profiler
    $uprofiler_data = uprofiler_disable();

    // display raw uprofiler data for the profiler run
    print_r($uprofiler_data);

Run the above test program:

.. code-block:: php

    $ php -dextension=uprofiler.so foo.php

You should get an output like:

.. code-block:: text

    Array
    (
        [foo==>bar] => Array
            (
                [ct] => 2         # 2 calls to bar() from foo()
                [wt] => 27        # inclusive time in bar() when called from foo()
            )

        [foo==>strlen] => Array
            (
                [ct] => 2
                [wt] => 2
            )

        [bar==>bar@1] => Array    # a recursive call to bar()
            (
                [ct] => 1
                [wt] => 2
            )

        [main()==>foo] => Array
            (
                [ct] => 1
                [wt] => 74
            )

        [main()==>uprofiler_disable] => Array
            (
                [ct] => 1
                [wt] => 0
            )

        [main()] => Array         # fake symbol representing root
            (
                [ct] => 1
                [wt] => 83
            )

    )

.. note::

    The raw data only contains "inclusive" metrics. For example, the wall time
    metric in the raw data represents inclusive time in microsecs. Exclusive
    times for any function are computed during the analysis/reporting phase.

.. note::

    By default only call counts & elapsed time is profiled. You can optionally
    also profile CPU time and/or memory usage. Replace, ``uprofiler_enable();``
    in the above program with, for example
    ``uprofiler_enable(UPROFILER_FLAGS_CPU + UPROFILER_FLAGS_MEMORY)``

You should now get an output like:

.. code-block:: php

    Array
    (
        [foo==>bar] => Array
            (
                [ct] => 2        # number of calls to bar() from foo()
                [wt] => 37       # time in bar() when called from foo()
                [cpu] => 0       # cpu time in bar() when called from foo()
                [mu] => 2208     # change in PHP memory usage in bar() when called from foo()
                [pmu] => 0       # change in PHP peak memory usage in bar() when called from foo()
            )

        [foo==>strlen] => Array
            (
                [ct] => 2
                [wt] => 3
                [cpu] => 0
                [mu] => 624
                [pmu] => 0
            )

        [bar==>bar@1] => Array
            (
                [ct] => 1
                [wt] => 2
                [cpu] => 0
                [mu] => 856
                [pmu] => 0
            )

        [main()==>foo] => Array
            (
                [ct] => 1
                [wt] => 104
                [cpu] => 0
                [mu] => 4168
                [pmu] => 0
            )

        [main()==>uprofiler_disable] => Array
            (
                [ct] => 1
                [wt] => 1
                [cpu] => 0
                [mu] => 344
                [pmu] => 0
            )

        [main()] => Array
            (
                [ct] => 1
                [wt] => 139
                [cpu] => 0
                [mu] => 5936
                [pmu] => 0
            )

    )

Skipping builtin functions during profiling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default PHP builtin functions (such as ``strlen``) are profiled. If you do
not want to profile builtin functions (to either reduce the overhead of
profiling further or size of generated raw data), you can use the
``UPROFILER_FLAGS_NO_BUILTINS`` flag as in for example
``uprofiler_enable(UPROFILER_FLAGS_NO_BUILTINS)``.

Ignoring specific functions during profiling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can tell uprofiler to ignore a specified list of functions during
profiling. This allows you to ignore, for example, functions used for indirect
function calls such as ``call_user_func`` and ``call_user_func_array``. These
intermediate functions unnecessarily complicate the call hierarchy and make the
uprofiler reports harder to interpret since they muddle the parent-child
relationship for functions called indirectly.

To specify the list of functions to be ignored during profiling use the 2nd
(optional) argument to ``uprofiler_enable``. For example:

.. code-block:: php

    // elapsed time profiling; ignore call_user_func* during profiling
    uprofiler_enable(0,
                 array('ignored_functions' =>  array('call_user_func',
                                                     'call_user_func_array')));

or,

.. code-block:: php

    // elapsed time + memory profiling; ignore call_user_func* during profiling
    uprofiler_enable(UPROFILER_FLAGS_MEMORY,
                  array('ignored_functions' =>  array('call_user_func',
                                                      'call_user_func_array')));

Setting up uprofiler UI
-----------------------

PHP source structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The uprofiler UI is implemented in PHP. The code resides in two subdirectories,
``uprofiler_html/`` and ``uprofiler_lib/``.

The ``uprofiler_html`` directory contains the 3 top-level PHP pages.

* ``index.php``: For viewing a single run or diff report.

* ``callgraph.php``: For viewing a callgraph of a uprofiler run as an
  image.

* ``typeahead.php``: Used implicitly for the function typeahead form
  on a uprofiler report.

The ``uprofiler_lib/`` directory contains supporting code for display as well
as analysis (computing flat profile info, computing diffs, aggregating data
from multiple runs, etc.).

Web server config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You'll need to make sure that the ``uprofiler_html/`` directory is accessible
from your web server, and that your web server is setup to serve PHP scripts.

Managing uprofiler Runs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clients have flexibility in how they save the uprofiler raw data obtained from
an uprofiler run. The uprofiler UI layer exposes an interface iuprofilerRuns
(see uprofiler_lib/utils/uprofiler_runs.php) that clients can implement. This
allows the clients to tell the UI layer how to fetch the data corresponding to
a uprofiler run.

The uprofiler UI libaries come with a default file based implementation of the
iuprofilerRuns interface, namely "uprofilerRuns_Default" (also in
uprofiler_lib/utils/uprofiler_runs.php). This default implementation stores
runs in the directory specified by ``uprofiler.output_dir`` INI parameter.

A uprofiler run must be uniquely identified by a namespace and a run id.

**a) Saving uprofiler data persistently**:

Assuming you are using the default implementation ``uprofilerRuns_Default`` of
the ``iuprofilerRuns`` interface, a typical uprofiler run followed by the save
step might look something like:

.. code-block:: php

    // start profiling
    uprofiler_enable();

    // run program
    ....

    // stop profiler
    $uprofiler_data = uprofiler_disable();

    //
    // Saving the uprofiler run
    // using the default implementation of iuprofilerRuns.
    //
    include_once $uprofiler_ROOT . "/uprofiler_lib/utils/uprofiler_lib.php";
    include_once $uprofiler_ROOT . "/uprofiler_lib/utils/uprofiler_runs.php";

    $uprofiler_runs = new uprofilerRuns_Default();

    // Save the run under a namespace "uprofiler_foo".
    //
    // **NOTE**:
    // By default save_run() will automatically generate a unique
    // run id for you. [You can override that behavior by passing
    // a run id (optional arg) to the save_run() method instead.]
    //
    $run_id = $uprofiler_runs->save_run($uprofiler_data, "uprofiler_foo");

    echo "---------------\n".
         "Assuming you have set up the http based UI for \n".
         "uprofiler at some address, you can view run at \n".
         "http://<uprofiler-ui-address>/index.php?run=$run_id&source=uprofiler_foo\n".
         "---------------\n";

The above should save the run as a file in the directory specified by the
``uprofiler.output_dir`` INI parameter. The file's name might be something like
``49bafaa3a3f66.uprofiler_foo``; the two parts being the run id
("49bafaa3a3f66") and the namespace ("uprofiler_foo"). [If you want to
create/assign run ids yourself (such as a database sequence number, or a
timestamp), you can explicitly pass in the run id to the ``save_run`` method.

**b) Using your own implementation of iuprofilerRuns**

If you decide you want your uprofiler runs to be stored differently (either in
a compressed format, in an alternate place such as DB, etc.) database, you'll
need to implement a class that implements the iuprofilerRuns() interface.

You'll also need to modify the 3 main PHP entry pages (index.php,
callgraph.php, typeahead.php) in the "uprofiler_html/" directory to use the new
class instead of the default class ``uprofilerRuns_Default``. Change this line
in the 3 files.

.. code-block:: php

    $uprofiler_runs_impl = new uprofilerRuns_Default();

You'll also need to "include" the file that implements your class in the above
files.

Accessing runs from UI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**a) Viewing a Single Run Report**

To view the report for run id say <run_id> and namespace <namespace> use a URL
of the form:

    http://<uprofiler-ui-address>/index.php?run=<run_id>&source=<namespace>

For example,
``http://<uprofiler-ui-address>/index.php?run=49bafaa3a3f66&source=uprofiler
_foo``

**b) Viewing a Diff Report**

To view the report for run ids say <run_id1> and <run_id2> in namespace
<namespace> use a URL of the form:

    http://<uprofiler-ui-address>/index.php?run1=<run_id1>&run2=<run_id2>&source=<namespace>

**c) Aggregate Report**

You can also specify a set of run ids for which you want an aggregated
view/report.

Say you have three uprofiler runs with ids 1, 2 & 3 in namespace "benchmark".
To view an aggregate report of these runs:

    http://<uprofiler-ui-address>/index.php?run=1,2,3&source=benchmark

**Weighted aggregations**:

Further suppose that the above three runs correspond to three types of programs
p1.php, p2.php and p3.php that typically occur in a mix of 20%, 30%, 50%
respectively. To view an aggregate report that corresponds to a weighted
average of these runs using:

    http://<uprofiler-ui-address>/index.php?run=1,2,3&wts=20,30,50&source=benchmark

Notes on using uprofiler in production
--------------------------------------

Some observations/guidelines. Your mileage may vary:

* CPU timer (getrusage) on Linux has high overheads. It is also coarse grained
  (millisec accuracy rather than microsec level) to be useful at function
  level. Therefore, the skew in reported numbers when using UPROFILER_FLAGS_CPU
  mode tends to be higher.

  We recommend using elapsed time + memory profiling mode in production. [Note:
  The additional overhead of memory profiling mode is really low.]

  .. code-block:: php

      // elapsed time profiling (default) + memory profiling
      uprofiler_enable(UPROFILER_FLAGS_MEMORY);

* Profiling a random sample of pages/requests works well in capturing data that
  is representative of your production workload.

  To profile say 1/10000 of your requests, instrument the beginning of your
  request processing with something along the lines of:

  .. code-block:: php

     if (mt_rand(1, 10000) == 1) {
       uprofiler_enable(UPROFILER_FLAGS_MEMORY);
       $uprofiler_on = true;
     }

  At the end of the request (or in a request shutdown function), you might then
  do something like:

  .. code-block:: php

     if ($uprofiler_on) {
       // stop profiler
       $uprofiler_data = uprofiler_disable();

       // save $uprofiler_data somewhere (say a central DB)
       ...
     }

  You can then rollup/aggregate these individual profiles by time (e.g., 5
  minutely/hourly/daily basis), page/request type,or other dimensions using
  ``uprofiler_aggregate_runs()``.

Lightweight Sampling Mode
-------------------------

The uprofiler extension also provides a very light weight **sampling mode**.
The sampling interval is 0.1 secs. Samples record the full function call stack.
The sampling mode can be useful if an extremely low overhead means of doing
performance monitoring and diagnostics is desired.

The relevant functions exposed by the extension for using the sampling mode are
``uprofiler_sample_enable()`` and ``uprofiler_sample_disable()``.

Additional Features
-------------------

The ``uprofiler_lib/utils/uprofiler_lib.php`` file contains additional library
functions that can be used for manipulating/ aggregating uprofiler runs.

For example:

* ``uprofiler_aggregate_runs()``: can be used to aggregate multiple uprofiler
  runs into a single run. This can be helpful for building a system-wide
  "function-level" performance monitoring tool using uprofiler. [For example,
  you might to roll up uprofiler runs sampled from production periodically to
  generate hourly, daily, reports.]

* ``uprofiler_prune_run()``: Aggregating large number of uprofiler runs
  (especially if they correspond to different types of programs) can result in
  the callgraph size becoming too large. You can use ``uprofiler_prune_run``
  function to prune the callgraph data by editing out subtrees that account for
  a very small portion of the total time.

Dependencies
------------

* JQuery Javascript: For tooltips and function name typeahead, we make use of
  JQuery's javascript libraries. JQuery is available under both a `MIT and GPL
  license <http://docs.jquery.com/Licensing>`_. The relevant JQuery code, used
  by uprofiler, is in the ``uprofiler_html/jquery`` subdirectory.

* dot (image generation utility): The callgraph image visualization ([View
  Callgraph]) feature relies on the presence of Graphviz "dot" utility in your
  path. "dot" is a utility to draw/generate an image for a directed graph.

Acknowledgements
----------------

The HTML-based navigational interface for browsing profiler results is inspired
by that of a similar tool that exists for Oracle's stored procedure language,
PL/SQL. But that's where the similarity ends; the internals of the profiler
itself are quite different.
